Database start - mongod --dbpath <path to data directory>
  I created a new database folder for it to use on my machine.  
  from the f1 folder it is:
    mongod --dbpath ../data/db
    then used this link https://alicoding.com/how-to-start-mongodb-automatically-when-starting-your-mac-os-x/ to initialize
    i believe this has the dbpath as something different - /var/lib/mongodb/
Express node start - nodemon

11/27 - due to data availabiliy and structure, going to use mysql with sequelize bith from npm instead of mongo
the password i entered for this server's root was 123qweasd
f1app profile's password will be 'hamgroper'

017-11-27T22:51:15.383140Z 1 [Note] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: 0U=:MFP:gAcC

If you lose this password, please consult the section How to Reset the Root Password in the MySQL reference manual.


12/23 - After defining the model etc. Constructor is giving hell for eager loading.  Might be due to naming convention?  Either way going to rename the table to 'teams',
