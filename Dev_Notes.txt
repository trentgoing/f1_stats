Database start - mongod --dbpath <path to data directory>
  I created a new database folder for it to use on my machine.  
  from the f1 folder it is:
    mongod --dbpath ../data/db
    then used this link https://alicoding.com/how-to-start-mongodb-automatically-when-starting-your-mac-os-x/ to initialize
    i believe this has the dbpath as something different - /var/lib/mongodb/
Express node start - nodemon

11/27 - due to data availabiliy and structure, going to use mysql with sequelize bith from npm instead of mongo
the password i entered for this server's root was 123qweasd
f1app profile's password will be 'hamgroper'

017-11-27T22:51:15.383140Z 1 [Note] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: 0U=:MFP:gAcC

If you lose this password, please consult the section How to Reset the Root Password in the MySQL reference manual.


12/23 - After defining the model etc. Constructor is giving hell for eager loading.  Might be due to naming convention?  Either way going to rename the table to 'teams',

7/20 - updated the streamgraph.  It now looks good and has UI elements.  

HITLIST
   1.) Add Remove - Be able to highlight drivers on the left panel, and then update the Streamgraph such that it only includes those.  The path should be already open, as the drivers variable can dictate the Keys, and which drivers show up.  However, we should get the left panel to dictate selection first. Then, we can add the reload/update which should be related to below 
   2.) Initialize - need the streampgraph to reload on smart navigation between races
   3. Color Changes for the teams
